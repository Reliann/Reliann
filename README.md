## Hello, I'm Rell. 
##stuff about me:
I'm very passionate about programming and I'm looking for job as a junior fullstack developer.
my go-to language is predictably python, javascript is a close second.
I do know C#, some assembly (check out my DOS game) and c++ to some extent. 

##I'm currently working on my portfolio, and I'm trying out the following:
#for the backend:
express
django /django rest framework
firebase/ mongoDB as DB

#for the frontend:
react
django-templetes (?)

and in the future I hope to try out and learn- next.js, vue/angular, making mobile apps, and unity (for game making).

Aside from that my hobbies are drawing, modeling (with blender) and playing video games.
